# :book: About this Project

This is the tech challenge of Metrobi.

All 7 questions are in this repository, each one is inside its own folder.

# :construction_worker: How to Use

Before starting, you need to have installed in your machine: [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or other package manager), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
and a code editor (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

```bash

# Clone this repository via HTTPS:
$ git clone https://github.com/gustavopolonio/Metrobi-Technical-Challenge.git

# Open a terminal and go into the main folder:
$ cd Metrobi-Technical-Challenge

```

To run questions 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 go to the desired folder and run the `index.js` file using Node:

```bash

# Go to the desired folder, e.g. to run the first question:
$ cd ./01

# Run the `index.js` file:
$ node index

```

To run questions 3 and 6 go to the desired folder and install dependencies:

```bash

# Go to the desired folder, e.g. to run the third question:
$ cd ./03

# Install dependencies:
$ npm install

# Start the application in a development environment:
$ npm run dev

```
